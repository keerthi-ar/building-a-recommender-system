# Building a Recommender System

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a recommender system for an e-commerce platform to personalize user experiences, helping users discover new products or content based on their behavior and preferences.

## Dataset:
This project uses the **MovieLens Dataset** provided by **GroupLens Research**. The dataset contains user ratings for movies, and we use it to build a recommendation engine that suggests movies or products based on collaborative filtering and content-based techniques.

- **Dataset URL**: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

## Project Overview:
In this project, we build and evaluate a recommender system that utilizes both collaborative filtering (SVD) and content-based methods. The following techniques are used:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Use user-item interactions to recommend items based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Content-based Filtering**: Recommend items based on the features of the items and the userâ€™s previous preferences.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combine collaborative and content-based methods for better recommendations.
- **Matrix Factorization**: We implement Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for better prediction accuracy.

We also focus on handling **cold-start problems** for new users or items and incorporate **contextual information** such as the time of day into the recommendations.

## Steps Taken:

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
- Explored and cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
- Encoded categorical variables (like genres) for machine learning compatibility.
- Handled inconsistencies in user and movie IDs.
- Split the data into train and test sets for model evaluation.

### Recommender System Model:
- Implemented **SVD** (Singular Value Decomposition) for collaborative filtering.
- Trained and tested the model on the MovieLens dataset to make personalized recommendations.
- Evaluated the model using metrics like **RMSE** and **MAE**.

### Cold-Start Problem:
- Developed a solution to handle new users who have no ratings by recommending popular movies or those based on preferred genres.

### Contextual Recommendations:
- Incorporated time of day as a feature to recommend movies that match the user's time-based preferences.

### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluated the system using cross-validation techniques.
- Measured the **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** and **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** to assess the accuracy of the model.

### Real-time Model Updates:
- Implemented a mechanism to update the recommendation system with new user ratings in real-time.
